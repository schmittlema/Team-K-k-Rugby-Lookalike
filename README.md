**Description**

Our game is about teaching people the computer vision concept of facial recognition. Using rugby players, students learn in a fun way which features a computer uses to recognize a face. At the end, students get to see which of their favorite rugby players they look like!

**Installation Steps**

Our game must be run through a server, but other than that there are no other installation instructions.

**Usage**

You will need to run the game through a web server and have it point to inside this repository (e.g. WAMP). Once you open the page in a browser you must allow the page access to your webcam (usually a popup).

**Known Bugs**

Camera does not work on the tablet

This link leads to code that should hopefully solve that issue but may require an overhaul
